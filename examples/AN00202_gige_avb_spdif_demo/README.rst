Gigabit Ethernet AVB endpoint example using I2S master
======================================================

.. appnote:: AN00202

.. version:: 1.0.4

Summary
-------

This application note demonstrates a Gigabit Ethernet AVB endpoint that streams uncompressed audio
over an Ethernet AVB network with guaranteed Quality of Service, low latency and time synchronization.
It shows how to interface with a high performance audio codec via the I2S library.

The application is configured to provide a single Talker and Listener stream of 8 audio channels
at up to 192kHz sampling rate.

The example also shows plug-and-play multichannel recording and playback with Apple Mac hardware running OS X 10.10.

Required hardware
.................

The application note is designed to run on the XMOS xCORE-200 Multichannel Audio platform version 2.

There is no dependency on this hardware and the firmware can be modified to run on any xCORE XE/XEF
series device with the required external hardware.

The firmware was interoperability tested with a Late 2013 MacBook Pro running OS X version 10.10.3.

Prerequisites
